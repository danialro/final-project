            <p>While there is a total consensus about the importance of exercising, studies show that 73% of people do not meet their fitness goals.</p>

            <p>The motivation we get from buying new sports gear or watching Rocky 4 (our favorite Rocky) is quickly challenged by modern life (more work, less time, endless temptations). *StickyCarrot is here to help you get fit and stay fit, using two types of extremely efficient incentives: money and social recognition.*</p>

            <h4>Here's how it works:</h4>

            <p>Say your goal is to run 4 miles each week. You can create or join a weekly challenge group (we call them "Carrots"). To join, you must pledge a small entrance fee. (Don't worry! You won't actually have the money deducted until… well, keep reading.) In fact, if you meet the Carrot’s weekly goal each week (as verified by API connections to Runkeeper and Fitbit), you will never be charged, ever.</p> 

            <p>You can even make money! Each week, we check whether you met the goal. If you didn't, your pledge money is given to everyone who did.</p>

            <p>Just to keep things interesting, you’ll also get alerts when a member in your carrot starts running, showing you how much money they stand to make from you and all the other people who didn’t run yet this week.</p>

            <P>Sure, we get that the money is a gimmick. But if it gets you running further, faster, and more frequently, we're all for it.</P>

            <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Ready to run?</h3>
